## About

GitHub doesn't provide a UI for configuring which events a web hook listens to.
Hookup provides a simple way to manage the events for web hooks.

## Command line tool

### Installation

```sh
npm install -g hookup
```

### Usage

```sh
hookup -l username -p password -r user/repo -u http://example.com/hook -e push,status
```

## Node module

### Installation

```sh
npm install hookup
```

### Usage

```js
var hookup = require( "hookup" );
var client = hookup.createClient({
	username: username,
	password: password
});
client.addWebHook({
	repo: "user/repo",
	events: [ "push", "status" ]
});
```

The node module contains lower-level methods for interacting with hooks and the
GitHub API in general.

## Events

The following events are available:

* `push` - Any git push to a Repository.
* `issues` - Any time an Issue is opened or closed.
* `issue_comment` - Any time an Issue is commented on.
* `commit_comment` - Any time a Commit is commented on.
* `create` - Any time a Repository, Branch, or Tag is created.

* `pull_request_review_comment` - Any time a Commit is commented on while inside a Pull Request review (the Files Changed tab).
* `gollum` - Any time a Wiki page is updated.
* `watch` - Any time a User watches the Repository.
* `release` - Any time a Release is published in the Repository.
* `fork` - Any time a Repository is forked.
* `fork_apply` - Any time a patch is applied to the Repository from the Fork Queue.
* `member` - Any time a User is added as a collaborator to a non-Organization Repository.
